Fine-tuned LLaMA 2 and Falcon models on the Amod mental health counseling dataset using Chain-of-Thought and Instruction Prompting techniques for empathetic response generation.
This project contains the fine-tuned versions of LLaMA 2 and Falcon language models using the Amod dataset focused on mental health counseling dialogues. Two prompting techniques Instruction Prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) were applied to enhance the models' empathetic and context-aware responses.
